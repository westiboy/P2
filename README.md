#Description
This project is the second in a series of 4 projects for CSCI E-15 at the Harvard Extension School, Fall 2015. This particular project is a a password generator that meets the xkcd theoretical comlexity of "44 bits of entropy." Specifically, it uses a word list of the 25 of each of the most common perpositions, verbs, adjectives, and nouns, and a random integer and special character if selected, to compile a random password. The more words, the higher the complexity.
My thinking in including these specific selections, was to try to create random phrases, rather than a completely random collection of words. Studies have shown that passphrases are easier to remember than passwords, and can still provide the needed level of complexity (given certain additional criteria).

The page consists of:

Title - "44 Bits of Entropy" password generator*

An explanation of why passwords need to be generated in a different way than traditionally requested by security practices, based on the type of description given in the xkcd comic (though the complexity and efficacy of this criteria debatable).

A box containing the password (empty by default)

Form fields to request the number of words,  and whether or notinclude numbers and special characters.

A live link to the xkcd comic which inspired thhe generator.

##Demo
TBD

I compiled a list of the 25 most common of each: Prepositions, Verbs, Adjectives, and Nouns. The following URLs were the source material:
